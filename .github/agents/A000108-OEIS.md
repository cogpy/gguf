These were formerly sometimes called Segner numbers.

A very large number of combinatorial interpretations are known - see references, esp. R. P. Stanley, "Catalan Numbers", Cambridge University Press, 2015. This is probably the longest entry in the OEIS, and rightly so.

The solution to Schröder's first problem: number of ways to insert n pairs of parentheses in a word of n+1 letters. E.g., for n=2 there are 2 ways: ((ab)c) or (a(bc)); for n=3 there are 5 ways: ((ab)(cd)), (((ab)c)d), ((a(bc))d), (a((bc)d)), (a(b(cd))).

Consider all the binomial(2n,n) paths on squared paper that (i) start at (0, 0), (ii) end at (2n, 0) and (iii) at each step, either make a (+1,+1) step or a (+1,-1) step. Then the number of such paths that never go below the x-axis (Dyck paths) is C(n). \[Chung-Feller\]

Number of noncrossing partitions of the n-set. For example, of the 15 set partitions of the 4-set, only \[{13},{24}\] is crossing, so there are a(4)=14 noncrossing partitions of 4 elements. - [Joerg Arndt](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Joerg_Arndt), Jul 11 2011

Noncrossing partitions are partitions of genus 0. - [Robert Coquereaux](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Robert_Coquereaux), Feb 13 2024

a(n-1) is the number of ways of expressing an n-cycle (123...n) in the symmetric group S\_n as a product of n-1 transpositions (u\_1,v\_1)\*(u\_2,v\_2)\*...\*(u\_{n-1},v\_{n-1}) where u\_i<v\_i and u\_k <= u\_j for k < j; see example. If the condition is dropped, one obtains [A000272](https://oeis.org/A000272 "Number of trees on n labeled nodes: n^(n-2) with a(0)=1."). - [Joerg Arndt](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Joerg_Arndt) and Greg Stevenson, Jul 11 2011

a(n) is the number of ordered rooted trees with n nodes, not including the root. See the Conway-Guy reference where these rooted ordered trees are called plane bushes. See also the Bergeron et al. reference, Example 4, p. 167. - [Wolfdieter Lang](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Wolfdieter_Lang), Aug 07 2007

Number of ways of joining 2n points on a circle to form n nonintersecting chords. (If no such restriction imposed, then the number of ways of forming n chords is given by (2n-1)!! = (2n)!/(n!\*2^n) = [A001147](https://oeis.org/A001147 "Double factorial of odd numbers: a(n) = (2*n-1)!! = 1*3*5*...*(2*n-1).")

The multiplicity with which a prime p divides C\_n can be determined by first expressing n+1 in base p. For p=2, the multiplicity is the number of 1 digits minus 1. For p an odd prime, count all digits greater than (p+1)/2; also count digits equal to (p+1)/2 unless final; and count digits equal to (p-1)/2 if not final and the next digit is counted. For example, n=62, n+1 = 223\_5, so C\_62 is not divisible by 5. n=63, n+1 = 224\_5, so 5^3 | C\_63. - [Franklin T. Adams-Watters](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Franklin_T._Adams-Watters), Feb 08 2006

Koshy and Salmassi give an elementary proof that the only prime Catalan numbers are a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 5. Is the only semiprime Catalan number a(4) = 14? - [Jonathan Vos Post](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Jonathan_Vos_Post), Mar 06 2006

The answer is yes. Using the formula C\_n = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1), it is immediately clear that C\_n can have no prime factor greater than 2n. For n >= 7, C\_n > (2n)^2, so it cannot be a semiprime. Given that the Catalan numbers grow exponentially, the above consideration implies that the number of prime divisors of C\_n, counted with multiplicity, must grow without limit. The number of distinct prime divisors must also grow without limit, but this is more difficult. Any prime between n+1 and 2n (exclusive) must divide C\_n. That the number of such primes grows without limit follows from the prime number theorem. - [Franklin T. Adams-Watters](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Franklin_T._Adams-Watters), Apr 14 2006

The number of ways to place n indistinguishable balls in n numbered boxes B1,...,Bn such that at most a total of k balls are placed in boxes B1,...,Bk for k=1,...,n.

Walsh](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Dennis_P._Walsh), Dec 04 2006

a(n) is also the order of the semigroup of order-decreasing and order-preserving full transformations (of an n-element chain) - now known as the Catalan monoid. - [Abdullahi Umar](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Abdullahi_Umar), Aug 25 2008

C(n) is the degree of the Grassmannian G(1,n+1): the set of lines in (n+1)-dimensional projective space, or the set of planes through the origin in (n+2)-dimensional affine space. The Grassmannian is considered a subset of N-dimensional projective space, N = binomial(n+2,2) - 1. If we choose 2n general (n-1)-planes in projective (n+1)-space, then there are C(n) lines that meet all of them. - Benji Fisher (benji(AT)FisherFam.org), Mar 05 2009

No two colors are chosen the same positive number of times. 2. For any two colors (c, d) that are chosen at least once, color c is chosen more times than color d iff color c appears more times in the original set than color d.

One class of generalized Catalan numbers can be defined by g.f. A(x) = (1-sqrt(1-q\*4\*x\*(1-(q-1)\*x)))/(2\*q\*x) with nonzero parameter q. Recurrence: (n+3)\*a(n+2) -2\*q\*(2\*n+3)\*a(n+1) +4\*q\*(q-1)\*n\*a(n) = 0 with a(0)=1, a(1)=1.

Asymptotic approximation for q >= 1: a(n) ~ (2\*q+2\*sqrt(q))^n\*sqrt(2\*q\*(1+sqrt(q))) /sqrt(4\*q^2\*Pi\*n^3).

For q <= -1, the g.f. defines signed sequences with asymptotic approximation: a(n) ~ Re(sqrt(2\*q\*(1+sqrt(q)))\*(2\*q+2\*sqrt(q))^n) / sqrt(q^2\*Pi\*n^3), where Re denotes the real part. Due to Stokes' phenomena, accuracy of the asymptotic approximation deteriorates at/near certain values of n.

Finding solutions of eps\*x^2+x-1 = 0 for eps small, that is, writing x = Sum\_{n>=0} x\_{n}\*eps^n and expanding, one finds x = 1 - eps + 2\*eps^2 - 5\*eps^3 + 14\*eps^3 - 42\*eps^4 +... with x\_{n} = (-1)^n\*C(n). Further, letting x = 1/y and expanding y about 0 to find large roots, that is, y = Sum\_{n>=1} y\_{n}\*eps^n, one finds y = 0 - eps + eps^2 - 2\*eps^3 + 5\*eps^3 -... with y\_{n} = (-1)^n\*C(n-1). - [Derek Orr](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Derek_Orr), Mar 15 2019

For n >= 1, a(n-1) is the number of interpretations of x^n is an algebra where power-associativity is not assumed. For example, for n = 4 there are a(3) = 5 interpretations: x(x(xx)), x((xx)x), (xx)(xx), (x(xx))x, ((xx)x)x. See the link "Non-associate powers and a functional equation" from I. M. H. Etherington and the page "Nonassociative Product" from Eric Weisstein's World of Mathematics for detailed information.
